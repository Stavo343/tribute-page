  <div class="text-left">
    <p id="intro">The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a phenomonal experience set in the Third Age of Tolkien's Middle-Earth. Created by Nate French and published by Fantasy Flight Games, this living card game explores the possibilities of Tolkien's lore set in the seventeen years between Gandalf leaving the Shire and Frodo beginning his journey to Bree. The game is structured in five different forms aside from the Core Box:</p>
      <ul id="first-ul" class="text-left">
        <li class="hangingindent"><b>Deluxe Expansions</b> - These expansions are required to play any quests in their corresponding cycles. The only exception is the first cycle, Shadows of Mirkwood, where the Core Set acts as the deluxe expansion.</li>
        <li class="hangingindent"><b>Adventure Packs</b> - These expansions flesh out a cycle for the game. Each cycle consists of one deluxe expansion and six adventure packs, all containing a cohesive theme.</li>
        <li class="hangingindent"><b>Saga Expansions</b> - These deluxe expansion-sized boxes each contain three quests that follow events in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy books. For those who want to experience the events of Tolkien's actual stories, these are excellent!</li>
        <li class="hangingindent"><b>Print on Demand (POD) Decks</b> - Each year for GenCon and Fellowship events, FFG releases extra special quests enriched with theme and clever mechanics for fans to gather together and enjoy playing for a thematic challenge.</li>
        <li class="hangingindent"><b>Nightmare Packs</b> - For the hardcore player, nightmare packs integrate themselves with their specific corresponding quests in order to give an even more challenging experience than the original quests.</li>
    </ul>
